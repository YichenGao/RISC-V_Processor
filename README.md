# RISC-V_Processor
- Developed and optimized a pipelined RISC-V processor to achieve performance improvements and meet a 600 ps clock period constraint.
- Implemented a real memory system with instruction, data caches, and ALU to enhance processor efficiency and overall system performance.
- Demonstrated adaptability and problem-solving skills by working with a given assembly code and minimizing cycles per instruction (CPI) to optimize performance within the specified constraints.
